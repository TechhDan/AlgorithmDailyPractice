# Algorithm Daily Practice

## Introduction
Welcome to Algorithm Daily Practice â€“ a daily algorithm practice repository designed for consistent improvement and mastery of algorithms. Whether you're a beginner sharpening your skills, or an experienced coder keeping your edge, this repository offers a structured approach to algorithm mastery through daily practice.

## Goals
- Improve understanding and implementation of algorithms.
- Develop a consistent daily coding habit.
- Provide a resource for learning and revisiting various algorithms.
- Encourage test-driven development and clean code practices.

## How to Use
- **Daily Practice:** Three times a day, implement an algorithm by memory in the `practice_sessions` directory.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests for each algorithm to ensure correctness.
- **Review and Reflect:** Regularly review your implementations and refactor for improvements.
- **Collaborate and Share:** Feel free to fork, contribute, or use this repository for your learning journey.

## Directory Structure
- `/algorithms`: Categorized algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching).
- `/practice_sessions`: Daily practice code (reset every session).
- `/tests`: Unit tests for each algorithm.
- `/docs`: Additional notes or resources.
